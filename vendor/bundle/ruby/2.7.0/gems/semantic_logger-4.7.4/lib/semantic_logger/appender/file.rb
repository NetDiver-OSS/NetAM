#
module SemanticLogger
  module Appender
    class File < SemanticLogger::Subscriber
      # Create a File Logger appender instance.
      #
      # Parameters
      #  :file_name [String]
      #    Name of file to write to.
      #  Or,
      #  :io [IO]
      #    An IO stream to which to write the log messages to.
      #
      #  :level [:trace | :debug | :info | :warn | :error | :fatal]
      #    Override the log level for this appender.
      #    Default: SemanticLogger.default_level
      #
      #  :formatter: [Object|Proc]
      #    An instance of a class that implements #call, or a Proc to be used to format
      #    the output from this appender
      #    Default: Use the built-in formatter (See: #call)
      #
      #  :filter [Regexp|Proc]
      #    RegExp: Only include log messages where the class name matches the supplied
      #    regular expression. All other messages will be ignored.
      #    Proc: Only include log messages where the supplied Proc returns true
      #          The Proc must return true or false.
      #
      # Example
      #    require 'semantic_logger'
      #
      #    # Enable trace level logging
      #    SemanticLogger.default_level = :info
      #
      #    # Log to screen
      #    SemanticLogger.add_appender(io: STDOUT, formatter: :color)
      #
      #    # And log to a file at the same time
      #    SemanticLogger.add_appender(file_name: 'application.log', formatter: :color)
      #
      #    logger = SemanticLogger['test']
      #    logger.info 'Hello World'
      #
      # Example 2. To log all levels to file and only :info and above to screen:
      #
      #    require 'semantic_logger'
      #
      #    # Enable trace level logging
      #    SemanticLogger.default_level = :trace
      #
      #    # Log to screen but only display :info and above
      #    SemanticLogger.add_appender(io: STDOUT, level: :info)
      #
      #    # And log to a file at the same time, including all :trace level data
      #    SemanticLogger.add_appender(file_name: 'application.log')
      #
      #    logger =  SemanticLogger['test']
      #    logger.info 'Hello World'
