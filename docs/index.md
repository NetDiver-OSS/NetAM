# NetAM Documentation
Here you can find documentation about Network Address Manager a.k.a. NetAM.

## Description
NetAM is a software built on a bundle of network oriented tools.

NetAM can also be used as IPAM (IP Address Manager). 

You can create sections and schedule scans (Ping, TCP or UDP) for your sections.
You can request for a free ip address for any section and manage network range usage.
To manage any type of network architecture, you can define a VLAN identifier on each section (by default 1).
In addition, you can create and visualize rackspace usage in NetAM.

NetAM provides an option to run scan worker individually.
With this option you can split your scan load and increase VLAN isolation.
